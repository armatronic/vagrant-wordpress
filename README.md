Vagrant Wordpress setup script
---

A Vagrant file for setting up a simple Wordpress site. It is targeted mainly at
Wordpress developers, but could be used by anyone wanting to set up a Wordpress
installation.

It uses the Wordpress Chef recipe, and extends it to install WP-CLI, thus
automating all parts of the Wordpress install and setup.
